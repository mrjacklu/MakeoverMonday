# MakeoverMonday Project Files

## Description of MakeoverMonday

*This project is based on the popular [#MakeoverMonday](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MakeoverMonday?src=hashtag_click&pf=on) data initiative run by Tableau Zen Master, [Andy Kriebel](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/), and [Eva Murray](https://trimydata.com/), Head of Business Intelligence at Exasol. Each week they provide an article that contains a data visualization and data set. Participants are able to look at the data set and see if they can come up with a better story, a different story by redesigning the chart using Tableau.*
